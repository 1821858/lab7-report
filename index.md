Dara Arbab
Lab Report 4

Step 1 for this lab was to log into the ieng6 server.

I did this by typing the following:

ssh cs15lwi23axd@ieng6.ucsd.edu

A password is not needed to log in as I already have an ssh key set up for the server.

Step 2 for this lab is to use the git clone command to clone the lab repository from my github into the server.

I did this by first copying the git address for the repo, then, typing the following:

git clone <COMMAND> <V>
-- command v pasted the following: git@github.com:1821858/lab7.git
